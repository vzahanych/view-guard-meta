rule:
  description: "After each implementation step, always test regression by running all available tests to ensure no previous functionality is broken."
  onStepEnd: |
    - Run the project's full test suite at the end of every implementation step.
    - Address any test failures before considering the step complete.
    - Document test results for each step.
  rationale: "This ensures continuous regression coverage and prevents the introduction of bugs that could compromise existing features."
